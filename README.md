# Vault

## What is it?

Vault is my personal digital library where I collect, organize, and preserve the knowledge, inspiration, and connections that fuel my work as a designer and engineer.

## Motivation

As someone who works at the intersection of design and engineering, I needed a space to collect articles, tutorials, and insights that inspire my work, keep track of interesting people in the design and tech communities, save videos and talks that teach me new skills or perspectives, and build a personal archive of the things that matter to my creative process. This isn't just a websiteâ€”it's my digital library, a place where I can quickly access the resources that help me grow professionally and stay inspired.

## What's Inside

- **Articles** - A collection of articles, tutorials, and insights that inspire my work
